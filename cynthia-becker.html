                I am Cynthia Becker, a mom of 2 kids. I was previously married for 12 years until unfortunate circumstances occurred and I became extremely ill. My husband made choices that negatively affected our family and left us in a position for Child Protective Services to get involved. In 2017, everyone including my own family turned their back on me and my children. While I was in the hospital, fighting for my life, my mother (with the help of CPS) KIDNAPPED my children! If it weren’t for my faith in Christ, I don’t think I would have survived this horrific time in my life. <br> <br>
                Being left homeless, divorced, no family or friends, fighting for my life and my name being drug through the mud, I was in the fight for my life. Every moment felt like I was fighting a loosing battle. I had NO idea that lies could literally destroy a person and leave them in such a detrimental state. Trying to prove my innocence over a 2-year period felt like a lifetime. My focus was to strengthen my health and body, go to court, work on my case plan, barely see my children (and when I did it was supervised), and rebuild my entire life ALONE was exhausting. <br> <br>
                At last, after searching for weeks and being turned down by over 50 different lawyers, I finally found an attorney who was brave, wise enough, and specialized in Juvenile Dependency cases. Finding an attorney was one of the most difficult part of the battle.  <br>
                I WON my case and was able to take my kids home, so I decided to dedicate my time and energy to help others in their fight with Child Protective Services. When I discovered that CPS was not about protecting our kids, but instead about their billion-dollar industry, I realized there was a lack of awareness and knowledge, therefore with my effort and perseverance, it led me to be an advocate to fight for what is right.                                       
                And because this is such a non-discussed issue, I started interviewing parents and family members which then created itself an entire show called- The Reality Series: CPS The Horror Stories to educate and give a voice to all those that CPS tried to silence. Using Social Media, I have created a community for families to gain the support that they not only need, but desire as they attempt to triumph Child Protective Services. Due to the rapid growth and following of this reality series, it opened the door and gave opportunity for me to Co-Host the Nationwide known radio show, The Secret: How to Fight CPS and Win! <br> <br>
                Having these 2 platforms made me realize the lack of lawyers assisting parents to cps cases. I usually hear parents begging me to help them find a lawyer. I came up with an idea of building a network, a Rolodex of attorneys wherein parents and families can have options to connect with the right and reliable attorneys to handle their cases.
                And now through CPS Attorney Rolodex, we bridge and unite attorneys and families. Making it easier and accessible to search and find the most dependable and trustworthy attorneys in your state. <br>
                To keep your families together.
